## Interests
I'm fascinated by people operations and corporate responsibility–particularly at startups and mid-sized companies. I enjoy learning about culture-building and innovative HR practices. 

I also love to adventure outdoors: rock hounding, hiking, trail running, and skateboarding are some of my favorite pasttimes.
